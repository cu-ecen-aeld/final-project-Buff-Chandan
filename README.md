# final-project-Buff-Chandan

# Overview
In this project, a prototype of a Weather reporting system for a Greenhouse farm is expected to be deisgned and implemented.
The readings from a temperature sensor and humidity sensor will be used to monitor the internal environment of the greenhouse farm. Here, the values of the sensors would be accessed and displayed for analysis.

The SHT21 sensor would measure the temperature and the HTU21 sensor would measure the humidity from the designated atmospehere. The project is intended to be built on a Beaglebone Black board platform. And the sensors shall use I2C protocol.

The image for the Beaglebone Black will be created with Buildroot and include necessary drivers and applications to communicate with the modules and provide methods to access the data collected.
